###rainfall per grid cell used:
Even after intense reading of the paper by Johnson and Miller provided with the module info, google searches and attempts to read the source code the rainfall input stays obscure to 
us. 

###influence of selected time-step
As can be seen in the chart the runoff seems to be simulated in the 
expected manner for continuous homogenous rainfall in case of a 
time-step of 1 hour. In case of 0.1 hours - i.e. 6 minutes - after rising steeply the curve is falling likewise after about 60 h of simulation time as if rainfall would have stopped by then. The quantity of homogenous rainfall might have been assumed by the programmer for the time-step (which is more probable in view of the huge difference in quantity of runoff) or the whole simulation time.
